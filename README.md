Summary: An interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual and Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
